# Variable and Type Naming

For variables, you will use lower camel case when naming them. For lower camel case the first word will be lowercase and for the rest of the words after will have the first letter capitalized. Example:

```jsx
int lowerCamelCase;
```

This is the rule for all variables except for when the variable is a constant in which case the name will be all caps with underscores between words.

```jsx
final int RULE_FOR_CONSTANT_VARIABLES;
```

For all types, you will use upper camel case which is the same as lower camel case except that the first letter of the first word is capitalized not lowercase.

```jsx
class UpperCamelCase
```
