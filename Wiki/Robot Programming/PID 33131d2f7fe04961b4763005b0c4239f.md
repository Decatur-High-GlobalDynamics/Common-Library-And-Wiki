# PID

It’s the special magic sauce of Mustard. It’s like Grey Poupon. Goes nice with ketchup. PID is used if we are trying to go from one particular value or position(elevator position, etc.) to another.

PID has three variables: Proportional, Integral, and Derivative. We don’t use integral in FRC. Proportional drives the value towards the target value. Derivative compensates for error.

To start, create PIDController object and variables to store the P, I, and D (either do testing and/or run [SysID](PID%2033131d2f7fe04961b4763005b0c4239f/SysID%20d6b8f24a86ad4772bf104b928fbb61b9.md)  to get the values):

```java
private static final double kP = 1.32;
private static final double kI = 0;
private static final double kD = .0185;

PIDController pid = new PIDController(kP, kI, kD);
```

Then, to calculate a power based on the PID, do (it returns the power/output):

```java
pid.calculate(current, target);
```
