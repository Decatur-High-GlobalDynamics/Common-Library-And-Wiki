# Clearing Sticky Faults

Sticky faults are something we have to fix. We don’t know exactly what they are, but when mechnaical says we need to clear them, here’s what to do:

1. Go to the robot, and bring your computer

2. Plug the orange cord (in the driver station) into any of the SparkMax motors

3. Open REV hardware client on your computer

4. Click through all the motors until you find the one with the sticky fault (It will say if it does). There will probably be multiple.

5. Click “clear faults” or “clear errors”
