# Running SJ2 Locally

- Before attempting this, make sure you’ve downloaded all prerequisites from the SJ2 GitHub!
- Launch the local version of MongoDB (mongod) by following this guide:

- Launch Redis by opening the redis-server file found wherever you downloaded Redis

- Open a web browser and go to “http://localhost:<YOUR_PORT>”
    - For example, using the above screenshot I would go to “localhost:4026”
- If you’re having issues with MongoDB timing out, go into the .env file and change the “localhost” part of MONGODB_URI to 127.0.0.1
